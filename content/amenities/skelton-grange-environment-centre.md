  We welcome people of all ages to learn, volunteer and play outdoors at our award-winning eco-centre and nature area in Leeds.

  We offer educational visits for schools and groups, education outreach sessions, support people to volunteer in conservation and education, and run lots of training and fun events for kids, adults, teachers, childminders and families!

  Our schools outreach project, The Flying Slug, has just relaunched in case you’d like us to come and visit you in school.

  We’d love to see you at Skelton Grange – join our Monday Green Gym or Friday Green Team to look after the wildlife area, kids can spend their holiday learning bushcraft skills, and adults can enjoy learning something new in our great course programme.
