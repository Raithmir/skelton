With help from 'The Friends of Skelton Grange', our Easter Good Friday event is a glorious outdoor trail wandering through the woods and gardens at Skelton Grange. Complete a treasure hunt along the way and trade in your trove for a chocolatey Easter surprise at the end! The event is a fundraiser for the Centre, but also a great chance for families to enjoy some Easter fun! The Skelton Cafe will be open to buy hot drinks and sweet treats at the end. Tickets are required for all children attending the event, but babies (18 months or under) are welcome free. Adults do not require a ticket if they are accompanied by a child or children. Tickets are £8 per child (plus Eventbrite booking fee). Choose your timeslot between 11am and 1pm.
