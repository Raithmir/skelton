## Overview

Skelton Gate is a modern residential development located in East Leeds, offering a mix of housing options for families, first-time buyers, and professionals. The estate is part of the larger Skelton Grange area, benefiting from excellent transport links and proximity to local amenities.

## History

The Skelton Gate development began in the early 2010s as part of Leeds City Council's vision to create sustainable, connected communities on the outskirts of the city. The site was transformed from former industrial land into a thriving residential area.

- **Barratt Developments** - Creating modern detached and semi-detached properties

Each builder brings their unique architectural style while maintaining the cohesive character of the community.

Recent improvements include:
- Enhanced landscaping and green spaces
- Improved pedestrian pathways
