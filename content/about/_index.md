## Overview

Skelton Gate is a modern residential development located in East Leeds, offering a mix of housing options for families, first-time buyers, and professionals. The estate is part of the larger Skelton Grange area, benefiting from excellent transport links and proximity to local amenities. A short drive away from Leeds City Centre, and minutes away from RSPB Skelton Lake nature reserve and historic Temple Newsam grounds.

## History

The Skelton Gate development planning began in the 2010s as part of Leeds City Council's vision to create sustainable, connected communities on the outskirts of the city. The site was transformed from former industrial land into a thriving residential area.

## Development

Phases 1a and 1b of the estate (438 homes) are being developed by several reputable housebuilders:

- **Avant Homes**
- **Evans Homes**
- **Countryside Homes (Vistry)**

Taylor Wimpey has submitted an application to develop phases 2a, 2b, 2c (an additional 370 homes).

A future phase 3 is also planned.

## Current Phase

Phase 1 is currently in its mature phase, with many properties now occupied. New residents continue to move into the remaining available plots, and the community continues to grow and establish itself.

Recent improvements include:

- Enhanced landscaping and green spaces
- Improved pedestrian pathways

## Future Plans

Future enhancements for the Skelton Gate community may include:

- **Community Hub** - A dedicated space for resident meetings and activities
- **Playground Upgrades** - Modernisation of existing play areas for children

The management company and residents' association continue to work together to improve the estate for all residents.
