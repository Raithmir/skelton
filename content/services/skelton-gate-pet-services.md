I will be offering occasional dog walking and pet drop-in visits right here in Skelton Gate.

If you’re at work, away for the day, or just need a bit of help now and then, I’m happy to help with:

 Dog walks

 Visits & toilet breaks

 Cat feeding and check-ins

 Small pet drop-ins

As a frenchie owner myself I know how important it is to trust someone with your pets, so they’ll always be treated like part of the family 

Feel free to comment or pop me a message if you’d like more info.
