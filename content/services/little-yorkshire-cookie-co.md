Welcome to Little Yorkshire Cookie Company, a small bakery nestled in the heart of Yorkshire. Our journey began with a passion for creating delightful sugar cookies that bring joy to every bite. We take pride in using locally sourced ingredients to craft our artisanal vanilla cookies, each baked with care and a sprinkle of Yorkshire charm.

Owner, Emma set up her first treat business in 2019, creating cakes, cupcakes and her most popular menu item Sugar Cookies. In 2024, Little Yorkshire Cookie Company was born, focusing on our premium hand-decorated, fondant topped Sugar Cookies.

We invite you to experience the warmth of Yorkshire hospitality with every box of our lovingly handcrafted sugar cookies. Join us on this delicious journey as we share the true essence of Yorkshire through our irresistible treats.
