**For properties still under warranty:**
Contact your builder's customer care team immediately, as heating is classed as an emergency issue.

**For properties out of warranty:**

1. Check your boiler pressure (should be 1-1.5 bar when cold)
2. Check that thermostats are set correctly
3. Ensure the timer/programmer is set appropriately
4. Try resetting the boiler (check manual)

If the issue persists, contact a Gas Safe registered engineer. Many residents use local heating engineers - ask neighbours for recommendations or check our Local Services directory.

**Emergency gas issues:** If you smell gas, call the National Gas Emergency Service on 0800 111 999 immediately.
