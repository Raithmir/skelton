No formal permit system exists for designated parking spaces at Skelton Gate. Your property deeds specify which parking space(s) belong to your home.

**Key points:**
- Each property has allocated parking as per your title deeds
- No permits or stickers are required for your own space
- Guest parking areas are available on a first-come, first-served basis
- Do not park in spaces allocated to other properties

If someone is parking in your designated space, contact the estate management company for assistance.
