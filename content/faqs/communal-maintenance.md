The estate management company (FirstPort) is responsible for maintaining all communal areas, including:

- Green spaces and lawns
- Pathways and roads
- Street lighting
- Play areas
- Communal bins and recycling areas

This is funded through your annual service charge. If you notice any maintenance issues in communal areas (broken lights, overgrown hedges, damaged paths), report them to FirstPort on 0333 321 2233 or via email.

Individual residents are responsible for maintaining their own front and rear gardens.
