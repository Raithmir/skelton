Contact your builder's customer care team as soon as possible after moving in.

- Your warranty covers defects for 2 years from purchase

Keep a written list of issues with photos where possible. The builder will typically arrange an inspection and schedule repairs. For urgent issues (water leaks, heating failure), contact them immediately.
